title: Explore SME matrix operations with interactive visualizations
description: Explore nine interactive views of ZA layout, transposition, operand preparation, and matrix multiplication to understand Arm SME data movement.

minutes_to_complete: 40

who_is_this_for: You want to understand Arm SME matrix data movement before reading or writing SME2 code.

learning_objectives:
    - Identify how the streaming vector length and element size change the views of ZA
    - Trace transposition, packing, and padding between memory and ZA
    - Compare three matrix multiplication views and explain how their input layouts affect loads and accumulation

prerequisites:
    - A browser with JavaScript enabled
    - Basic familiarity with vectors and matrix multiplication
